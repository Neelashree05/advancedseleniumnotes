FrameWork

Definition:- FrameWork is a well-Organized Structure of reusable components where one driver(.xml) file will 
             take care of the execution without manual intervention.

Definition:-FrameWork is a collection of reusable components that makes automation development execution and modification easier
             and faster.
Definition:-Frame Work is a set of instruction followed by every organization that makes automation test engineer life easy.

Types of FrameWork Approaches
Two Types of FrameWork Approaches:

1)TDD:-Test Driven Development
-TestCases are mandatory
-@Test is the driving factor for test script development.
-TDD focuses on the implementation of the System
-We use Programming language to write test cases like java.
-Small Application we use
-If Functionality changes impact is more

2)BDD:-Behaviour Driven Development
-Test Scenarios are mandatory.
-@Given,@When and @Then are used for test script development
-BDD explains the behaviour of the application for End users
-Here we use Gherkin language like English
-Big appliaction we use
-If functionality changes impact is less than TDD

Different types of FrameWOrk:-
1)Data Driven FrameWork
2)Modular Driven FrameWork
3)Method Driven FrameWork
4)KeyWord Driven FrameWork
5)Hybrid FrameWork

1)Data Driven FrameWork:-
What?:-Reading data from any External Resources or reading data from data provider is called as Data driven Framework.
       -Data is DRiven factor.
WHy?:-Automation rule says never hardcode the data,read it from external resources.
When?:-When ever the test Data is huge compared to test scenarios,We prefer data driven framework.
External Resources like:-Properties_File,Json,ExcelSheet,PDF,DataBAse,TestNG(.xml),cmd(Maven).
Examples:-Ecommerce, banking, Finance nd Travel etc.

2)Modular Driven FrameWork:-
What?:-Maintaining the test scripts,test data and suite xml file in module wise in order to make the debugging process easy 
       is called as modular driven frameWork.
Why?:-Code Modification and code maintaince is easy,Debugging is easy.
when?:-WHen every the application is huge and  has lot of modules, maintaining all the modules together will be difficult, Hence we
       prefer modular driven frameWork
Examples:-ECommerce,CRM

3)Method Driven FrameWork:
WHat?:-Developing the resuable methods for all the repeative action/Functionalities in the application and calling those methods in the test script is called method driven framework.
Why:-Method are reused, Test scripts are optimized
When?:-WHen ever Application contains more repeated Functionalities like too many dropdowns,frames,Switiching window
       Scrolling HAndling, we prefer Method Driven FrameWork
Example:-ECommerce , CRM

4)KeyWOrd Driven FrameWork:
What?:-Creating a keyword library and utilising these keywords to develop the test scripts is called KeyWord Driven FrameWork.
       Here KeyWord is the DRiven Factor
why?:-If non coder should perform Automation
when?:-When Ever the manual test engineers ,freshers have to perform automation,they would not be good at coding,hence we prefer
       Keyword driven framework.WHere all the actions are converted into methods with user friendly method name so that they can call 
       and perform the actions
Examples:-short term Projects.

5)Hybrid FrameWork:
What?:-Combination of Two or more FrameWork is called as Hybrid Driven FrameWork.
Why?:-SOme Application Will HAve Huge Data and also more number of modules so we have combine two features of frameWork to make the
      frameWOrk user friendly we prefer Hybrid FrameWOrk.
When?:-When ever the application demands to use more than one framework we use Hybrid frameWork.

Note:-Hybrid= Data Driven + Modular Driven
      Hybrid= Data Driven + Method Driven
      Hybrid= Data Driven + Modular Driven + Method Driven
      Hybrid= Data Driven + KeyWord Driven
      Hybrid= Data Driven + KeyWord Driven + Modular Driven + Method Driven
    

  Advantages of FrameWork:
-Test Script DEvelopment is faster and easier because of reusability
-Modification and maintaince of data is easy because data is stored in external resources.
-FrameWork provides automatic screenshot for failed scripts.
-FrameWork Supports Multiple executions like ,Batch Execution,Regional Regression Execution,Distributed Parallel Execution
and Cross Browser Execution.
-FrameWork Generates Accurate Test Report for each execution
-Optimizes the Test scripts

DisAdvantages of FrameWork:
-Should be good in programming
-Initial frameWOrk Development cost and Time is High.
