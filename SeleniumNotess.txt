IntroDuction To Automation:

1)What is AUTOMATION?
-Converting Manual Test Cases into Automation TestScripts by using Automation Tool is called as Automation

2)When we will go for Automation ?
-Automation always takes place on stable application.
-Application becomes stable when first release done for that application.
-Hence after release we should go for Automation.

3)Why should we go for Automation?
-For Repeative task which take place in Regression Testing.
-Time saving from Second release
-Accuracy of testing increases
-To sustain in market compitation.

4)What type of testing take place in Automation?
-Regression Testing

5)Is 100% Automation is possible?
-No

6)What is not Automatted?
-Otp releated scenarios
-Capcha releated scenarios
-Virtual keyboard
-Bio matric
-Audio,video releated Testcases
-Voice commands
-Gamming application
-If manual testcases steps are improper than that testcases are not automated.

          
              AUTOMATION TOOLS

Types of TOOLS
1.Functional Automation Tool
2.Non-Functional Automation Tool

Functional Automation Tool:-The Tools which are used to Automate Functional,Integration and System Test Cases 
Ex:- QTP,Selenium,Cypress,Appium,PostMan,RestAssured etc.

Commercial software --> commercial software has the source code(business logic written by developer)
 that only the person,team or organization that created it can edit,inspect,change and enhance/update 
it apart from them no one has access to do changes.

commercial tool ex:
QTP -->QTP stands for QuickTestProfessional, a product of Hewlett Packard(HP) and its a GUI tool.
         QTP tool helps testers to perform an automated functional testing.
         QTP supports only Windows OS
         QTP supports only two languages Java script and Visual Basic script.
         QTP doesnot support safari browser.

open source software --> open source software is computer software with its source code made available 
by the developer or organization to everybody to study,change,modify,enhance and distribute.

*OpenSource Tools------->Free of cost  Ex:-Selenium,Appium,Cypress etc

Ex:-QTP,Selenium,Appium,Cypress,PostMan,RestAssured etc.

Non-Functional Automation tool:-The Tools which are used to Automate Non-FUnctional or Performance Test Cases
Ex:-NeoLoad,LoadRunner,Jmeter,Appload etc.

1.Forecast
2.JMeter
3.Load Complete

                              SELENIUM

It is a open source tool which is used to test webapplications and mobile applications.

To perform webapps automation we use Selenium WebDriver.
To perform mobile application automation we use Appium

 What are the flavours/Edition of Selenium?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SeleniumRc:-RC Stands for RemoteControl
-It is the first ever Automation Tool comes under Selenium Community.
-It is a script based tool to automate web application.
-It supports any programming languages like java,Cshark,Rubby,JavaScript,phython etc.
-It supports any Operating System(OS) like Windows,Mac,Linux etc.
-It supports any Browser like Chrome,Firefox,Edge,InterExplore,Safari,Opera etc.

Disadvantage of SeleniumRC:-
-Seperate RC server is Compulsary to be installed in a system which consume huge memory.
Due to this RC will lag in Performance.
-It cant support secured web application.
-Maintance of Browser versions is difficult.
-It cant support DeskTop or windows application

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SeleniumIDE:
-IDE stands for Itegrated Development Environment
-It is one of the Automation Tool comes under Selenium Community
-It is a open Source UI based Automation Tool.

Advantages:-
-Automation Script Creation is very easy.
-Non Technical person can also perform Automation.
-BAtch Execution is very easy.

DisAdvantages:-
-Cant Automate Complex Scenarios.
-Supports only chrome,firefox.
-There is no reusability of commom scenarios.
-DataDrivenTesting is not Possible.
-FrameWork Creation is nOt Possible.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Selenium Grid:-
-It is one of the Automation Tool comes under Selenium Community
-Selenium Grid supports remote execution.
-Through Selenium grid we can run WebDriver Script in Multiple Sub Machines.
-Such kind of Execution is consider as Hub Nodes Execution.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Winium:-

-It is one of the Automation Tool comes under Selenium Community
-It is Automation tool to support windows and Desktop application.
-It is a Script based Automation tool.
-Now a days Winium is not in used in Selenium WebDriver Automation.Because WebDriver is compactible with 
other third party desktop automation tools to handle Desktop scenarios.
-These Third party tools are open source and much easier than winium.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Appium:-

-It is one of the Automation Tool comes under Selenium Community
-Its a open source Automation Tool for Mobile Application.
-Its a Script based Automation Tool.
-It supports Both android and Ios.

                 How selenium works?/Architecture of selenium webdriver
                     --------------------------------------------------------
Selenium version-3
Json wire protocol architecture(Selenium prev)

*For succesfull configuration of WebDriver Automation tool we required--
1) WebDriver Client Library
2) Browser Server
3) Actual Browser

WebDriver client Library  
------------------------
->Entire WebDriver libraries are available in the form of jars.(jar stands for JavaArchive and its an executable file format like .exe    etc....)
->In order to access the jars in our project,we have to configure this jar with our automation project.
->This WebDriver jar is totally collection of java class and interface.
->Within this jar we will get Json wire protocol which is required for communication between our testsccipts 
and Browser server.

Browser Server
----------------
->Browser server is an webService(All the services over web(cloud) is called as WebService) which is used to interact with actual browsers
(chrome,firefox,etc.....).
->Without browser server,script will never interact with actual browsers.
->Each and every browser has individual Browser servers.

Actual Browser
---------------
->Browsers are stand alone applications which is used to access webApplications.
(StandAlone appln means which is installed in the local sytem and only one user can use at a time examples notepad,vlc media player.......)
->Browsers must be installed in local system in order to run test scripts with that particular browser...

              How selenium 4 works?
          ---------------------------------
->As per selenium 4 ,jsonwire  protocol is replaced by W3C standard protocol.
-->W3C WebDriver(Selenium webdriver)
   W3--world wide web
   C--consortium--its a kind of forum..
->As per recent updation Browser servers and all browsers are operating on W3C protocol only.
->Due to this change ie with W3C protocol,
w3c--> world wide web consortium
                                          1) Conversion rate of code is minimized.
                                          2) Speed of execution is increased.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                     	Selenium-java architecture

1)Search Context (Interface)
   -->It Provides search mechanism to search the elements in the webpage.
   -->It is an interface which contains only two abstract methods.
      findElement() -->To search single element. 
      findElements() -->To search multiple elements. 

2)Selenium WebDriver(Interface)
   -->It provides a way to control the Browser.
   -->It is the core interface of selenium,without which we cannot start automation because it contains main browser controlling methods.
   -->It is an interface which has 11 abstract methods.   namely...

      1. get("") -->It is used to navigate particular URL(website) and wait till page load.
      2. getTitle() -->It will capture the current started page heading and later it will be saved in a variable and next
 it will be published in the console.
      3. getCuurentUrl() -->It fetches the URL of the opened application.
      4. getPageSource() -->It returns the source code of the page which stored as string.
      5. getWindowHandle() -->It is used to handle child windows.
      6. getWindowHandles() -->It is used to store all the opened window handles in the set data structure.
      7. close() -->It is used to close the browser window currently in focus.
      8. quit() -->It is used to close all the entire browser session with all its tabs and windows.
      9. navigate() -->It is used to perform different operations such as backward,forward,refresh,wait....etc in browsers history.
      10. manage() -->It is a method that returns instance/object of options interface.
      11. switchTo() -->It allows users to switch to a particular frame using frameId/window using  session Id.

3)Remote WebDriver(concrete class)
     -->It is an implementation concrete class for interfaces in selenium and also it is mainly used to run the testscripts 
from the host/local computer to the remote computer(selenium grid).
